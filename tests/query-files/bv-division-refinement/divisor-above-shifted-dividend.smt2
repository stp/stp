; There is no exact control leg here, and there cannot be an affordable one:
; the assertion is the negation of the fact, so anything that does not install
; the fact has to prove a 256-bit divider unsatisfiable, which does not finish.
; What this leg establishes is that the fact is offered, named and applied end
; to end at a realistic width -- not that it is true. That is established by
; BVAbstractionLemma_Test, which checks every fact against the operation
; exhaustively below seven bits, by sampling at eight through sixty-four, and
; against the circuit STP blasts for the operation itself.
