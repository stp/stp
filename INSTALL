STP is built with [CMake](http://cmake.org/), version 2.8.8 or newer.

CMake is a meta build system that generates build files for other tools such as
make(1), Visual Studio, Xcode, etc. For a list of generators supported on your
platform, consult `cmake --help`.

Useful configuration variables
==============================
Here are a few interesting configuration variables. These apply to all
generators.

    BUILD_SHARED_LIBS : Build shared libraries rather than static
    CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE : The build type (e.g. Release)
    CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX : The prefix for install (e.g. /usr/local )
    ENABLE_TESTING : Enable running tests
    SANITIZE : Use Clang's sanitization checks
    TEST_QUERY_FILES: Test STP externally by passing it query files in tests/query-files
    TUNE_NATIVE : Tune compilation to native architecture

Makefile
========

Quick start
-----------
To build STP run

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -G 'Unix Makefiles' /path/to/stp/source/root
    make

If you'd prefer a more in-depth explaination of how to configure, build
and install STP read on...

Build directory
---------------
CMake supports building in and out of source. It is recommended that 
you build out of source. For example in a directory outside of the
STP root source directory run

    mkdir build

Configuration
-------------
The simplest thing you can do is use the default configuration by running

    cd build/
    cmake -G 'Unix Makefiles' /path/to/stp/source/root

You can easily tweak the build configuration in several ways

* Run `cmake-gui /path/to/stp/source/root` instead of `cmake`. This
  user interface lets you control the value of various configuration
  variables and lets you pick the build system generator.

* Run `ccmake` instead of `cmake`. This provides an ncurses terminal
  interface for changing configuration variables.

* Pass "-D<VARIABLE>=<VALUE>" options to `cmake` (not very user friendly).
  It is probably best if you **only** configure this way if you are writing
  scripts.

You can also tweak configuration later by running

    make edit_cache

Then edit any configuration variables, reconfigure and then regenerate the
build system.

Build, test and install
-----------------------
After configuration you can build by running

    make

Remember you can use the `-j<n>` flag to significantly to decrease build
time by running `<n>` jobs in parallel (e.g. `make -j4`).

To run tests (optinal) you will need to setup the OutputCheck submodule if you
have not done so.

    cd /path/to/stp/source/root
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    cd build
    cmake -G 'Unix Makefiles' ENABLE_TESTING=ON ..
    make

You can then run the tests by running

    make check

Installation (optional) can be done by running

    make install

and files can be uninstalled by running

    make uninstall

The root of installation is controlled by the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable
at configure time. Remember you can easily change this at anytime by running

    make edit_cache

and editing the value of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.
