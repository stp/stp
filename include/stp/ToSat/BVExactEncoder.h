// Puts `result = a op b` into a SAT solver that is already running, over
// variables it already has.
//
// This is how --bv-term-abstraction gives up. A BVMULT, BVDIV or BVMOD it
// abstracted is refined by ruling out one pair of operand values at a time,
// and after a bounded number of those the refinement stops enumerating and
// says what the operation is. What it says has to be worth having: an
// abstraction that is abandoned late should leave the solver no worse off
// than one that was never taken, and the only way that holds is if the
// encoding it falls back on is the one the query would have had anyway.
//
// So this does not write clauses. It builds the circuit with the same
// BitBlaster that a plain solve uses, hands the AIG to the same ABC cut
// enumeration and technology mapping that ToCNFAIG uses, and splices the
// CNF that comes back onto the variables the abstraction has been talking
// about all along -- the operand proxies and the abstraction's own result
// bits. Hand-written gates were about twice the clauses for the same
// function, which is a strange thing to pay for at the exact moment the
// abstraction has admitted it is not helping.
//
// Nothing here is retractable and nothing needs to be: what it adds is a
// definitional fact about the operation, true whatever else is asserted.

// The four with no premise are not facts anyone would derive by thinking
// about division -- `x >=u -((-s) & (-t))` is the output of the syntax-guided
// synthesis that paper describes -- which is the argument for porting them
// rather than inventing a set.
//
// Which seven: the highest-firing ones measured on the queries that motivated
// this, 1161 firings between them over the 73 files STP could not decide.
// Fourteen more UDIV facts and sixteen UREM ones were left, the largest of
// them firing 125 times against this set's 161 to 280. They were not skipped
// on principle and the tail is not exhausted -- what stopped the porting is
// that these seven are a wash on that family, which is measured in the commit
// that adds them. Extending a set that does not pay needs a reason to expect
// the next one to.
