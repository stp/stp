// STLport debug checking, if we use STLport threads flag is to get
// rid of link errors, since iostreams compiles with threads.  alloc
// and uninitialized are extra checks Later on, if used with Purify or
// Valgrind, may want to set flags to prevent reporting of false
// leaks.  For some reason, _STLP_THREADS works on the command line
// but not here (?)
