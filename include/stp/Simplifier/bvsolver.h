   * This class represents the bitvector arithmetic linear solver.     
   *                                                                
   * The bitvector solver is a partial solver, i.e. it doesn't solve
   * for all variables in the system of equations. it is            
   * best-effort. it relies on the SAT solver to be complete.       
   *                                                                
   * The BVSolver assumes that the input equations are normalized, &
   * have liketerms combined etc.                                   
   *                                                                
   * 0. Traverse top-down over the input DAG, looking for a         
   * 0. conjunction of equations. if you find one, then for each    
   * 0. equation in the conjunction, do the following steps.        
   *                                                                
   * 1. check for Linearity of the input equation                   
   *                                                                
   * 2. Solve for a "chosen" variable. The variable should occur
   * 2. exactly once and must have an odd coeff. Refer CAV 2007
   * 2. paper on STP for actual solving procedure
   * 
   * 4. Outside the solver, Substitute and Re-normalize the input DAG
