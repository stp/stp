# This file wraps CMake invocation for TravisCI
# so we can set different configurations via environment variables.
#
# We could modify our CMake scripts to read environment variables directly but
# that would create two ways of setting the same thing which doesn't seem like
# a good idea.

# Search paths for the stp shared library
